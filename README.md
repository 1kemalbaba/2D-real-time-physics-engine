# 2D Real-Time Physics Engine

A simple and efficient 2D physics engine implemented in C++ with SFML rendering. This project demonstrates real-time rigid body dynamics with accurate collision handling.

## Overview

The engine simulates physical interactions between various objects in a 2D space, providing realistic motion and collision responses. It serves as an educational example of game physics implementation.

## Features

- Real-time rigid body dynamics
- Accurate collision detection and response
- SFML-based rendering system
- Vector-based physics calculations
- Support for multiple object types

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with C++17 support
- SFML 2.5 or higher
- CMake 3.10 or higher
